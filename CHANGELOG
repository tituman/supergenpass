# CHANGELOG

## 0.3.6

- BEHAVIOR CHANGE: SGP no longer automatically saves any changes to advanced
  options whenever you generate a password. There is a new "save" button,
  available when you are viewing the advanced options, that allows you to
  manually save changes to advanced options.

- Added hover text (title attributes) to some elements to provide functional
  explanations.
